## About Me

I am currently working as a Network Analytics Engineer at Eishaa Networks, Chennai. Further details about me can be found in [my resume](https://github.com/Subathra19/Subathra19.github.io/blob/main/resume.pdf)

## Projects

- **Low power design of Network on Chip (NoC) (Mar 2020 – Present)**:

The Network on-Chip (NoC)was designed to overcome the scalability problem associated with the SoC design. But the conventional Network-on-Chip is still in a basic level design, which was not designed for power efficiency. Hence, an enhanced NoC was designed by reducing the number of routers, introducing an efficient routing algorithm and several other features like packet screener and priority queues to achieve power efficiency and scalability. The results obtained by simulating the design in Simulinkv1.14 and are plotted in Matlabv2018b, which illustrates the advancements done to the NoC design and proves the efficiency of the enhanced NoC design over the conventional design.
In phase II of this project, as the processor architecture enters the multi-/many-core era, the interconnection and communication among the on-chip components are playing major roles in defining the performance, area, power consumption and reliability of the entire chip. Hence, the wired links on the Network on Chip design can be replaced by wireless links to provide low transmission latency and less power dissipation (even for long-distance nodes) when compared to the wired links.

- **LTE-A for military applications (Oct 2018 – Feb 2020)**:

A new BTS architecture is proposed that enables autonomous mesh network to support mobile entities, vehicle scenarios, and new use cases of PS and military communications. An enhanced evolved node base station (e2NB) has an integrated virtual UE(vUE) to enable in-band self-backhauling. It also has embedded core network elements and hosted applications and can provide services to legacy LTE UEs. An algorithm is used to efficiently meet QoS requirements for real-time traffic and maximize the throughput for elastic flows over the mesh network.

- **An innovative packet labelling scheme (TCP PLATO) for Data Center Networks (Jul 2017 – Jun 2018)**:

In data center networks, many applications such as cluster-based storage and MapReduce require many to one communication and high fan-in. When multiple synchronized servers send data to the same client in parallel, TCP incast congestion occurs. It leads to TCP throughput collapse, substantially degrading the performance of the application. Hence, the existing loss detection mechanism of TCP NewReno has been modified by a packet labelling scheme called TCP PLATO. In PLATO, labelled packets are given more priority over unlabelled packets at the switch. This allows TCP to detect packet loss by three duplicate acknowledgements and avoid RTO and thereby improve throughput. TCP PLATO has been simulated in ns-3 and its performance is compared with TCP NewReno for various buffer size, SRU, and topologies. Results are plotted with the help of MATLAB.
